## 🚀 My Featured Projects

_A selection of projects where I applied my skills in AI, NLP, and Computer Vision to solve real-world problems. For proprietary projects, I provide a detailed description of the architecture, my contributions, and the outcomes._

### 🛡️ Viettel Cyber Security (VCS) – Technical Specialist Projects  

> As a intern at VCS (since 09/2025), I worked on multiple in-house projects to strengthen network security and protect users from cyber threats.  

#### 📞 Project 1 – Scam Call & Social Media Fraud Detection  
> Developed a system to detect fraudulent activities through phone calls and social media platforms. Combined NLP-based content analysis with behavioral pattern recognition to identify scam attempts and alert users in real time.  
>
> <sub>**Tech:** NLP, Voice/Text Classification, ML Pipelines, FastAPI, Realtime Monitoring</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Internal Work]**
---
### 🏛️ Draft Law Advisory Chatbot (UBND Thanh Hóa)
> Developed an AI chatbot to assist internal teams in reviewing draft laws. After receiving a draft proposal, the system performs RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over related legal codes, identifies amendments or supplements mentioned, detects potentially relevant laws not explicitly referenced (e.g., a draft on agriculture may relate to land law), and provides decisions with detailed explanations.
>
> <sub>**Tech:** NLP, RAG, LLMs (GPT/Qwen), Vector Embeddings, Knowledge Graph, FastAPI</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

### ⚖️ Vietcombank (VCB) – Legal Data & AI Projects  

> I worked on three different projects with VCB, focusing on building AI-powered tools and infrastructure to handle large-scale legal and financial data.  

#### 📄 Project 1 – Linked Legal Document Storage System  
> Built a document storage system for legal texts with rich relational modeling, allowing tracking of edits, additions, or deletions across articles and clauses between different legal documents. Enables internal teams to navigate legal dependencies efficiently.  
>
> <sub>**Tech:** Graph Database, Python, Neo4j/Custom NoSQL, Data Modeling, FastAPI</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

#### 🧩 Project 2 – Metadata Extraction & Data Completion Tool  
> Developed a system to extract metadata and relationships between laws, then automatically filled missing field values in internal datasets to enhance data consistency and usability.  
>
> <sub>**Tech:** NLP, Information Extraction, Python, FastAPI, Data Cleaning Pipelines</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

#### 🏗️ Project 3 – Advanced Text2SQL with Context Engineering  
> Designed a framework for **Context Engineering** to enhance Text2SQL performance on massive databases. The system dynamically adapts prompts and query decomposition to handle complex financial/legal database queries.  
>
> <sub>**Tech:** LLMs (GPT/Qwen), Text2SQL, Prompt/Context Engineering, Knowledge Graphs, SQL Optimization</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

### 💬 VNPT – AI for Content Moderation & Media Analysis  

> I collaborated with VNPT on multiple AI projects focused on text and video content moderation for real-world applications.  

#### 📝 Project 1 – Vietnamese Toxic Comment Classification  
> Developed a multi-label classification system to detect toxic content for a corporate partner (VNPT). Achieved an **F1-score of 0.96+** in production.  
>
> <sub>**Tech:** PhoBERT, LLMs (GPT/Qwen), PyTorch, Few-shot Learning, FastAPI</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

#### 📹 Project 2 – Real-time Video Content Analysis  
> Built a real-time pipeline to detect sensitive content (political, violent) from live TV streams. The YOLOv12 model reached an **mAP@50-95 of over 70%**.  
>
> <sub>**Tech:** YOLOv12, PyTorch, OpenCV, Video Streaming, SAHI, Incremental Learning</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**
