## 🚀 My Featured Projects

_A selection of projects where I applied my skills in AI, NLP, and Computer Vision to solve real-world problems. For proprietary projects, I provide a detailed description of the architecture, my contributions, and the outcomes._

### 🏛️ Draft Law Advisory Chatbot (UBND Thanh Hóa)
> Developed an AI chatbot to assist internal teams in reviewing draft laws. After receiving a draft proposal, the system performs RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over related legal codes, identifies amendments or supplements mentioned, detects potentially relevant laws not explicitly referenced (e.g., a draft on agriculture may relate to land law), and provides decisions with detailed explanations.
>
> <sub>**Tech:** NLP, RAG, LLMs (GPT/Qwen), Vector Embeddings, Knowledge Graph, FastAPI</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

### ⚖️ Internal Legal Chatbot – Vietcombank (VCB)
> Developed an internal chatbot for VCB employees to quickly query and understand legal documents. The system parses complex legal texts and provides concise answers on regulations and internal policies.
>
> <sub>**Tech:** NLP, LLMs (GPT/Qwen), Vector Embeddings, FastAPI, Internal Knowledge Base</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

### 📄 Linked Legal Document Storage System (VCB)
> Built a document storage system for legal texts with rich relational modeling, allowing tracking of edits, additions, or deletions across articles and clauses between different legal documents. Enables internal teams to navigate legal dependencies efficiently.
>
> <sub>**Tech:** Graph Database, Python, Neo4j/Custom NoSQL, Data Modeling, FastAPI</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

### 📊 Internal Statistics Chatbot – MB Bank (MBB)
> Developed an internal chatbot for MB Bank employees to query statistics, reports, and tabular data. Utilizes Visual Language Models (VLM) with Toolformer integration for interactive data analysis and visualization.
>
> <sub>**Tech:** VLMs, Toolformer, Python, Pandas, Plotly, FastAPI, Vector Embeddings</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

### 💬 Vietnamese Toxic Comment Classification (VNPT)
> Developed a multi-label classification system to detect toxic content for a corporate partner (VNPT). Achieved an **F1-score of 0.96+** in production.
> 
> <sub>**Tech:** PhoBERT, LLMs (GPT/Qwen), PyTorch, Few-shot Learning, FastAPI</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

### 📹 Real-time Video Content Analysis (VNPT)
> Built a real-time pipeline to detect sensitive content (political, violent) from live TV streams. The YOLOv12 model reached an **mAP@50-95 of over 70%**.
>
> <sub>**Tech:** YOLOv12, PyTorch, OpenCV, Video Streaming, SAHI, Incremental Learning</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

### 🛡️ Network Anomaly Detection (IDS/IPS) (SCS)
> **Partner: SCS** | Developed an ML-based Intrusion Detection System to identify anomalous network behavior. The system analyzes multi-level data (packet, host, application) to enhance detection accuracy. I was responsible for data analysis, experimenting with models, and proposing solution improvements.
>
> <sub>**Tech:** XGBoost, Isolation Forest, Time-series Embedding, Scapy, Wireshark</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

### 🌐 Malicious Domain Detection (SCS)
> Designed a hybrid system (Rule-based + ML) to identify and block malicious websites, achieving **99.24% accuracy** on real-world traffic data for a cybersecurity partner (SCS).
>
> <sub>**Tech:** PyTorch, HDFS, FastAPI, Docker, Feature Engineering, Monitoring</sub>  
> ➡️ **[Project Details & My Role – Private due to NDA]**

### 🤖 AI-Powered Language Learning App (Personal Project)
> A full-stack web application to help users learn English/Chinese. Integrated LLMs for 8 features including interactive chat, grammar correction, and text-to-speech.
>
> <sub>**Tech:** React, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, Vector Embeddings, LLM APIs</sub>  
> ➡️ **[View on GitHub (Live Code)](https://github.com/ciTy1504/EngChi)**

### 📚 Library Management System (Personal Project)
> Developed a web-based application to manage book inventory and member borrowing records for small-scale libraries.
>
> <sub>**Tech:** JavaFX
> ➡️ **[View on GitHub (Live Code)](https://github.com/ciTy1504/MoneyManager-main)**
